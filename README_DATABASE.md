# Property Data Scraping - Database Version

This version stores scraped property data in a MySQL database instead of Excel files, providing a professional structure for frontend applications.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

### 1. Install MySQL

Make sure you have MySQL installed and running on your system.

### 2. Create Database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE property_data;
USE property_data;
```

### 3. Run Schema Script

Execute the `property_database_schema.sql` file to create all tables, views, and procedures:

```bash
mysql -u your_username -p property_data < property_database_schema.sql
```

## üîß Configuration

### 1. Update Database Configuration

Edit `sales_scraping_db.py` and update the `DB_CONFIG` dictionary:

```python
DB_CONFIG = {
    'host': 'localhost',  # Your database host
    'database': 'property_data',  # Your database name
    'user': 'your_username',  # Your database username
    'password': 'your_password',  # Your database password
    'port': 3306,  # Your database port
    'charset': 'utf8mb4',
    'autocommit': True
}
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements_db.txt
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Run the Scraper

```bash
python sales_scraping_db.py
```

## üìä Database Structure

### Main Tables:

- **properties** - Core property information
- **sale_rental_info** - Sale and rental details
- **household_info** - Owner and household information
- **additional_info** - Legal, features, and land values
- **nearby_schools** - School information
- **valuation_estimates** - Property and rental valuations
- **property_history** - Historical events
- **property_attributes** - JSON attributes
- **scraping_logs** - Monitoring and debugging

### Views:

- **property_complete_view** - Complete property data with all related information

### Stored Procedures:

- **GetPropertyComplete(property_url)** - Get complete property data
- **SearchProperties(address, type, min_price, max_price, limit)** - Search properties
- **GetScrapingStats()** - Get scraping statistics

## üîç Frontend Integration

### Example Queries:

#### Get Complete Property Data:

```sql
SELECT * FROM property_complete_view WHERE property_url = 'your_property_url';
```

#### Search Properties:

```sql
CALL SearchProperties('Melbourne', 'House', 500000, 2000000, 50);
```

#### Get Scraping Statistics:

```sql
CALL GetScrapingStats();
```

<!-- Natural risks feature removed -->

#### Get Properties with School Information:

```sql
SELECT p.address, COUNT(ns.id) as school_count
FROM properties p
LEFT JOIN nearby_schools ns ON p.id = ns.property_id
WHERE ns.catchment_status = 'In Catchment'
GROUP BY p.id, p.address;
```

## üìà Performance Features

### Indexes:

- All foreign keys have indexes
- Composite indexes for common query patterns
- Optimized for frontend queries

### Data Validation:

- Triggers for URL format validation
- Automatic numeric value conversion
- Data integrity constraints

### Monitoring:

- Scraping logs table for monitoring
- Performance tracking
- Error logging

## üîß API Integration Examples

### REST API Endpoints (using Flask/FastAPI):

### POST /scrape-property

Scrape a property by address and return sanitized, frontend-friendly JSON.

Notes:

- The first autocomplete suggestion is selected only if its similarity to the input address is at least 0.90. Otherwise the request aborts with an error.

Request:

```http
POST /scrape-property
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "address": "200 George Street Sydney NSW 2000"
}
```

Response 200:

## üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance

### Backup Database:

```bash
mysqldump -u your_username -p property_data > property_data_backup.sql
```

### Monitor Scraping:

```sql
SELECT 
    scraping_status,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    AVG(scraping_duration_seconds) as avg_duration
FROM scraping_logs 
WHERE scraped_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 DAY)
GROUP BY scraping_status;
```

### Clean Old Data:

```sql
-- Delete scraping logs older than 30 days
DELETE FROM scraping_logs WHERE scraped_at < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY);

-- Delete properties with no related data (optional)
DELETE p FROM properties p 
LEFT JOIN sale_rental_info sri ON p.id = sri.property_id
WHERE sri.property_id IS NULL;
```

## üîí Security Considerations

1. **Use Environment Variables** for database credentials
2. **Implement Connection Pooling** for production
3. **Add SSL/TLS** for remote connections
4. **Regular Backups** of your database
5. **Monitor Access Logs** for suspicious activity

## üìù Notes

- The database schema is designed for scalability and performance
- JSON fields provide flexibility for future data structure changes
- Views and stored procedures simplify frontend integration
- Comprehensive logging helps with debugging and monitoring
- The structure supports both simple queries and complex analytics
